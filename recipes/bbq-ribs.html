    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sliced onions</li>
        <li>2 cups ketchup</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons salt</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, combine onions, ketchup, water, salt, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, and mustard. Split ribs down the center between the bones.</li>
