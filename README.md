# odin-recipes

Before starting:
    I am doing this project for the Odin Project Foundations curriculum. I will be making a simple recipe webpage(s). 
    I will only be doing html at this point, no CSS or JS. I assume I will be making several pages that will be in
    a file structure. Those pages will be connected to each other via hyperlinks. On the pages themselves, I will
    likely have text, images, and lists (and some other formatting stuff).

Return once complete.
